Jesca, a Senior Program Advisor at UNICEF, has supported GEDA Uganda—a recently transitioned local NGO in Jinja—on MEAL and strategy during a period of rapid localization. After Jesca emphasized a stronger focus on outcomes (such as adolescent agency and gender-norm shifts), GEDA developed a detailed log frame with 47 indicators. Field teams are exhausted and uncertain. A donor has also warned against “politically sensitive themes,” just as GEDA considers expanding public LGBTQ+ advocacy. Additionally, UNICEF’s grants lead, Julia, helped GEDA create an Excel reporting template that works well but differs from UNICEF’s global format, raising concerns about audit readiness. Recently, GEDA has gone silent—joining calls with cameras off and offering minimal input. Jesca needs to decide how to re-engage and what to present at an upcoming regional learning session.
