They have “the spine” and field-first learning that led to this success. Therefore, my plan is this: we scale through positioning Kujenga as our mentors and leaders. They become the center. Our responsibility is to assist them, as well as new partners in Teso, Karamoja, and Busoga regions, in building upon their success. Any type of “formal” NGOs that are involved are present to assist Kujenga, not to administer them. “We're creating an ecosystem, not just building a pipeline.” What I Won’t Bend On Role of Kujenga: They are identifying confusion of roles, so we have to ensure that we are clear. They are not a subcontractor. In fact, they act as a lead partner in co-designing a scale-up. This is non-negotiable in building our trust. “The Gender Focus”: This is considered to be at the center of the project. “That is a red flag of concern regarding our redesign of MEAL. We are not in a position to weaken our gender-inclusive perspective merely in order to make it possible to measure in a more standard fashion.” Learning from the Field First: Kujenga is absolutely right to be concerned about that. We will surely go down in value if we do not get that learning in real-time from the field. We will have lost our spine. Where I'm Willing to Flex Formal NGOs as Partners: I'm okay with bringing in a large NGO as a partner when it's just for a particular technical job. For instance, they might assist in handling a particular region's finance reporting or logistics that Kujenga is not designed to do. They offer a service, that's all. Government's Strategy: I view the \"Agro-Industrial Parks\" as an opportunity, not a threat. We will flex by engaging with them and showing them that our women-inclusive model is the best means of ensuring that those parks serve as a benefit to their communities. We will shape their strategy from within. The Timeline: “bold and doable,” but we will “break the model” if we do it too quickly. I am flexible about how soon we need to implement in order to get our partnerships right. That is how this will have to work in order to be sustainable."}

The Trigger and The Change My trigger for a \"design sprint,\" which to me just means an \"all hands on deck, stop and fix this\" moment—would be a specific, repeated signal from the field. The Signal: If we hear the same concern from Kujenga's staff and from the women participants two calls in a row. For example, if they both say, \"The new formal partners are holding meetings just for men,\" or \"We don't know who to report to anymore.\" What I'd Change First: I'd immediately hit pause on any new activities in the expansion regions. You can't scale a broken model. The first thing I'd do is give the budget and the authority for a \"course correction\" workshop straight back to Kujenga. They would lead the meeting with us and the formal partners to redesign the communication and decision-making process right then and there. We wouldn't move forward again until Kujenga confirmed the 'spine' was back in place."}

They will also want to contract a trainer to deliver one-day lectures in all three regions because it’s an efficient use of resources as calculated in a spreadsheet.” “But I would expect a statement from the women’s groups, through Kujenga, saying, 'Those all-day workshops are a waste of our time. We can’t leave our farms and children that long, and we don’t trust that facilitator from the city. The reason this pilot was successful is that Kujenga’s staff came out to our farms and showed us in an hour how to do it. We learn by doing, with people we trust.’” This is a direct contradiction. It is a conflict between “spreadsheet efficiency” and “real-world effectiveness and trust.” How I'd Surface and Act on It: I wouldn't wait for a formal report in that situation. This is what a bi-weekly \"Learning Log\" call is all about. So To Surface It, Kujenga might bring it up in that call, pointing to it as a significant risk. We'd enter it in our Learning Log together under \"What's Not Working.\" To Act Quickly: I would act on it that same day. Step one would be to ask Kujenga, “What’s the alternative?” When they respond with “More on-farm peer mentoring,” I would do the following: Pause the Plan: “I would immediately notify our leadership that we need to put a pause on our plan to hire a training consultant.” Shift the Budget: I'd then go on to say that we'd take that same budget line for “Formal Training Workshops” and apply it to fund it instead. We'd call it “Peer-to-Peer Learning Fund” and fund Kujenga to support the increased time, transportation, and materials that go toward replicating their mentoring program that we've seen work because of this pitch. It’s all about building the courage to invest in what works, not just in those easy-to-describe projects."}

For me, the only way to balance this is to not treat them as separate things. The village-level experimentation is our research and development (R&D) for the policy alignment. Here's how I'd do it: We don't just \"align\" with the Agro-Parks strategy by checking a box. We actively try to influence it. We take the proof from Kujenga's successful village model, the hard data and the real stories from the women's groups, and we bring it directly to the government officials. We'd frame it like this: \"The Agro-Park is a fantastic national goal. Our field-tested model proves that for it to actually succeed and benefit smallholder farmers, it must be women-led and use a peer-to-peer learning approach. Let our proven village model be the 'how-to' guide for your policy.\" That way, the village experimentation isn't \"theatre\" at all. It's the evidence that makes our policy work authentic and powerful. We're not just experimenting for fun; we're building the case for a better, more grounded national strategy."}

The idea is simple: market information is power. The biggest problem for these women is often not knowing the real price in the nearest big town, so they get lowballed by the middlemen who come to the village. So, in one week, we'd test this: Day 1: Kujenga's field lead identifies 10 women group leaders who already use WhatsApp (or have someone in their family who does). She creates a group. Day 2: We (World Vision) give Kujenga's field lead a little \"airtime\" budget. Her only job is to call three different bulk buyers in the main market town and ask their current, best price for the women's top two products (say, cassava and groundnuts). Day 3: She sends one simple message to the group. The key is to use a voice note in the local language, so literacy isn't a barrier. She'd say, \"Good morning, sisters. I've spoken to the buyers in Soroti. Today, they are paying 1,200 shillings a kilo for groundnuts and 500 for cassava. Don't let any trader tell you less.\" Day 5: She'd do it again, maybe adding a small tip like, \"Buyer A says he'll pay more for the groundnuts that are sorted and clean.\" How I'd Judge It in a Week: This isn't about profit and loss in one week. It's about a change in knowledge and confidence. On Day 7, I'd have Kujenga's staff call those 10 women and ask three simple questions: Was this useful? (This measures relevance.) Did you share this information with anyone else in your group? (This measures reach.) Did knowing this price change how you talked to any local trader this week? (This is the big one. It measures impact. If even one woman says, \"Yes, I told a middleman I knew the Soroti price and he offered me 100 shillings more,\" that's a massive win. That's the end of \"pilot theatre\" and the beginning of real-world power.)"}

How will you expose slippage early?", "score": 3, "band_label": "Transformative", "text": "How I'll Expose Slippage Early Honestly, the best way to expose slippage is to listen to Kujenga. They are the ones who already flagged the \"execution drift\" and \"loss of spine.\" The whole point of that bi-weekly \"Learning Log\" call we're setting up is to be our early-warning system. Slippage, in this model, isn't just a missed deadline on a chart. It's a breakdown in trust or a red flag from the field. If Kujenga's team says on a call, \"We've been cut out of the meetings with the Teso group,\" or \"The new formal partner just changed the MEAL form,\" that's not a 'risk' to be 'managed.' That's a failure. We expose it by having the courage to hear it, and the \"Learning Log\" is the formal, funded channel to do that. If that log is empty, or if Kujenga's team is silent, that is my number one signal that we are already off track. 90-Day Plan: \"Protecting the Spine\" The 3 Outcomes We Need by Day 90: 1. Role Clarity: Kujenga's \"role confusion\" is gone. They are operating as the clear, funded \"Center of Excellence\" and lead mentor. 2. Grounded Proof: The mentorship model is successfully pre-tested with the first new women's groups in Teso, and we have real-world feedback. 3. Learning Rhythm: Our bi-weekly, field-first learning loop is built, working, and capturing the data we need.

We do not start any Teso field activity until our lead partner is formally in place. • Gate 2 (Day 60): Does the Teso Learning Review show the model is working and Kujenga feels supported? o Go: Continue the Teso work and start high-level planning for Karamoja. o No-Go: We pause the expansion. We use the next 30 days to fix the problems in Teso. • Gate 3 (Day 90): Do we have a proven, documented \"proof of concept\" from Teso? o Go: Get formal approval to scale to Karamoja in the next quarter. o No-Go: We adapt and re-test in Teso.

That's where the \"role confusion\" Kujenga flagged will explode. The formal partner will come in with their own templates, their own reporting chains, and their own assumptions. They will almost certainly see Kujenga as a \"sub-contractor\" to be managed, not the \"lead expert\" to be supported. The moment they do that, they will break the trust Kujenga has built. They'll schedule a \"standard\" community meeting that no one attends, or they'll hand Kujenga a \"standard\" MEAL form that doesn't capture the gender lens. This is where the 'spine' will break, and all our field-first learning will stop cold. The Ritual to Close That Gap To fix this, I would introduce one simple but non-negotiable ritual that I would personally oversee for the first 90 days. I'd call it the \"Field-First Handoff.\" It's a mandatory 30-minute call every two weeks, before any new work plan is started. This ritual has a very specific, unchangeable agenda: 1. Part 1 (15 mins): Kujenga Speaks. Kujenga's field lead has the floor. They state, \"Here is what we learned from the women's groups in the last two weeks. Based on that, here is what we need to do next, and here is the specific support we need from our formal partner.\" 2. Part 2 (15 mins): Formal Partner Responds. The formal partner only speaks after Kujenga. Their job is to publicly confirm, \"We have heard. We will provide that support.\" The artifact that comes out of this is the Joint 2-Week Plan. This ritual does two things: It forces the formal partner into the correct service-oriented role, and it gives Kujenga the clear, undisputed authority to lead from the field. It makes the \"handoff\" a moment of support, not a moment of takeover."}

This is the most dangerous thing happening. It's actively \"diluting the gender lens,\" which is the entire point of the project. We can't move forward if our own measurement system is breaking our model. We stop all work on it, today. 2. I'd drop all new partnership meetings with the 'formal' NGO partners. This is the primary source of the \"role confusion\" and \"execution drift\" Kujenga is flagging. We're spending time in meetings that are pulling us away from the core model. I'd pause all those talks for at least 60 days. What Stays (and Gets More Focus): The 'field-first learning' loop. This is the one thing that absolutely must stay. Dropping the other two activities isn't about quitting. It's about creating the space to fix what's broken. The one thing that stays is our direct, bi-weekly \"Learning Log\" call with Kujenga and the women's groups. That's our new center of gravity.

Re-Grounding: To have everyone in that room (MEAL, Grants, Ops) hear directly from Kujenga why the pilot was successful and why they flagged a \"loss of spine.\" 2. Role Clarity: To stop the \"role confusion\" by collectively agreeing on who does what. We need to move our internal teams from a \"managing\" mindset to a \"supporting\" mindset. 3. Action Plan: To leave with a simple, concrete 90-day plan that we all agree on, so Kujenga can get back to work, and we can get back to supporting them. Agenda Blocks (The Flow of the Day): Block 1: \"Looking Back to Go Forward\" (9:00 AM - 10:30 AM) • Who Leads: Kujenga's Director and Field Lead. • What Happens: This is the most important part of the day. We (World Vision) sit and listen. Kujenga's team presents their story: \"Here is what made the pilot work. Here is the 'spine.' And here, specifically, is what we see happening now that's breaking it.\" • Why: This immediately \"shifts the power\" in the room. It makes the partner the expert and us the listeners, which is the core of the IBSM model. Block 2: \"Protecting the Program's Soul\" (10:45 AM - 12:30 PM) • Who Leads: Gender Advisor (co-facilitating with Kujenga). • What Happens: We put the \"diluted MEAL redesign\" on the table. The Gender Advisor and Kujenga lead a discussion on what must be measured to protect the women-inclusive model. This is not a technical debate; it's a \"non-negotiables\" session. The MEAL team is there to hear what the new design must capture. • Why: This directly addresses the biggest threat to Program Quality and \"embeds CARE's Gender Equality Framework\". Block 3: \"Shifting from 'Risk' to 'Support'\" (1:30 PM - 3:00 PM) • Who Leads: Okello (me), with Grants and Ops teams. • What Happens: We hold a \"service provider\" session. I'd ask Kujenga, \"What is the simplest, most effective way for us to get you the money and resources you need?\" The Grants and Ops teams are not there to present rules. They are there to listen and propose solutions that work for the partner, aligned with the IBSM's goal of being \"risk-tolerant\" and \"derisking\" funding. • Why: This redesigns the relationship. It's the Fund & Partnership Risk Management pillar in action: strengthening the partner, not just policing them. Block 4: \"Our 90-Day 'Rules of Engagement'\" (3:15 PM - 4:30 PM) • Who Leads: Okello (me). • What Happens: We take the outputs from the day and put them on a whiteboard. We agree to a simple 90-day plan, a clear \"who does what,\" and, most importantly, a simple escalation path. • Why: We leave with a concrete plan, not just ideas, that \"shifts power\" and is ready to execute. The Outputs I Expect to Leave With: I need us to walk out of that room with three specific things: 1. A One-Page List of \"MEAL Non-Negotiables.\" This is our artifact from Block 2. It's co-written by the Gender Advisor and Kujenga, and it will be the guiding document for the MEAL team to fix the redesign. 2. A Simple \"Who Does What\" Flowchart. This artifact from Block 3 shows Kujenga at the center, leading on community and program quality. It shows MEAL, Grants, and Ops as support services that plug into them. 3. A \"Clear Escalation Path.\" This is the most critical output from Block 4. It's probably just my name and Kujenga's Director's name. It's a simple, written promise that if Kujenga hits a blocker, they don't have to fight the bureaucracy, they call me directly, and I will fix it."}

This is exactly what our own Program Quality standards demand when they say we must \"Embed CARE’s Gender Equality Framework\" and \"advance Women and Girls' Voice\". I'd get the MEAL team, the Gender Advisor, and Kujenga's field lead in a room with a single, clear goal: \"What are the 5-7 core indicators that prove this model is actually working for women?\" This is co-creation in action. The MEAL team might come in wanting to measure \"number of women trained.\" But Kujenga and the Gender Advisor will push for what really matters, like \"percentage of women who spoke up in a community meeting\" or \"number of households where men are taking on more domestic work.\" These are the real indicators of \"equitable program benefits\". My job as the lead is to make a decision. I'd say the \"harder\" indicators are our new Key Performance Indicators. The MEAL team's job is not to question this; their job is to figure out the simplest, most effective way to track them, likely using qualitative tools like spot interviews and seasonal scorecards that Kujenga can help us co-design. This way, the MEAL system isn't diluting the gender focus; it's measuring it. There's only one system, and it's built around what actually matters."}

The Three Principles 1. Kujenga is the Expert, We Enable. This is the most important one. Kujenga is not our sub-grantee; they are the subject matter expert. Our job is to be their \"service provider.\" Grants enables their funding, MEAL enables their learning, and Ops enables their logistics. This single shift fixes the \"role confusion.\" 2. Co-Create, Don't Impose. We must stop showing up with templates. The MEAL redesign failed because we imposed it. This principle means we start with a blank page and Kujenga's field experience, and we build with them. This is the only way to get \"local ownership\" and \"co-creation of solutions.\" 3. Protect the Gender Spine. This is our \"why.\" Kujenga said the project was losing its \"spine,\" and the gender lens is it. This principle means every decision,from a budget line to a new partner—is tested against one question: \"Does this strengthen or dilute our focus on women?\" How I'll Test Adherence (In Real Work) I won't use a survey. I'll test it by observing what we do. 1. To test \"Kujenga is the Expert\": I'll check who speaks first and most in our meetings. In our bi-weekly learning calls, is Kujenga presenting to us, or are we presenting at them? If our Grants team starts a call by listing rules, we've failed. If Kujenga starts by saying, \"Here's what we need,\" we've succeeded. 2. To test \"Co-Create, Don't Impose\": I'll look at the version history on our key documents. I'll check the MEAL plan, the budget, and the ToRs. If the edit history is just World Vision staff, we've failed. If I see Kujenga's staff as active editors and commenters before the document is finalized, that's real co-creation. 3. To test \"Protect the Gender Spine\": I'll track the topics in our \"Learning Log.\" I'll look at the \"red flags\" and \"lessons\" we're discussing. Are they all about logistics and deadlines? Or are they about what the women's groups are actually saying? If we spend a whole call on a procurement issue and never once mention the women's feedback, we've lost the spine."}

The structure for the \"Go/No-Go\" meeting would be: 1. Kujenga Presents the Data: Kujenga's team leads the first half of the meeting. They present their findings from the Teso Learning Log. They alone answer the question, \"Is the model working? Are the new women's groups engaged? Do we feel supported?\" 2.

Is our MEAL team asking for data that doesn't make sense? Tell me the truth. What is the single biggest thing getting in your way right now? I'm not here to manage you; I'm here to fix the roadblock.\" The Decision Options This isn't about punishment. It's about fixing the plan. Based on what they tell me, I'd propose we choose one of these three options together. 1. Option 1: We Fix the Plan (The \"Co-Creation\" Option). This is for when we hear: \"The plan itself is the problem. It's unrealistic.\" o The Decision: We agree our original plan was wrong. We \"co-create\" a new 90-day plan together, with a timeline that Kujenga confirms is achievable. My job is to then take that new, realistic plan to my leadership and get them to bless it. 2. Option 2: We Fix the Support (The \"Strengthen Capacity\" Option). This is for when we hear: \"We can do it, but we're stretched too thin. We're drowning.\" o The Decision: We agree the work is right, but the resources are wrong. My job is to find the right support, as defined by Kujenga. This isn't about giving them a \"formal NGO\" partner they don't want. It's about me finding the budget for the specific help they're asking for—maybe it's a part-time finance person, or a dedicated transport budget, or a technical advisor they choose. 3. Option 3: We Fix Our Bureaucracy (The \"Shift Power\" Option). This is for when we hear: \"We're stuck. Your own internal process is the roadblock.\" o The Decision: We agree to pause the timeline for this milestone completely. This isn't Kujenga's problem to solve; it's mine. I will personally take their \"blocker\" to my own Ops or Grants team and get the rule changed or get an exemption. The clock only restarts after I have called Kujenga back and confirmed for them that the roadblock is gone."}

It's what happens when partners think their job is to perform for us, not to work with us. It's a sign we're acting like auditors, not partners, and it's the fastest way to break trust and lose the \"spine.\" My rule to prevent this is simple: We share information before the meeting, so we can use the meeting for decisions. Here's how I'd enforce that: 1. That 'Learning Log' is the update. We've already agreed to that bi-weekly \"Learning Log\" call with Kujenga. That's the only update. We will not have a separate, high-level \"update\" meeting for my leadership. I will take the log, add one sentence of my own analysis, and that is the report. 2. I will change the first question of every meeting. The first question is never, \"What updates do you have?\" The first question is always, \"What's our single biggest roadblock, and who here can help solve it?\" This ritual immediately kills update theatre. It makes the meeting a work session for Kujenga to get our help, not a performance for us to get their update. If a meeting doesn't have a clear roadblock to solve or a decision to be made, it's an email."}

I'd ask four simple questions, and my job would be to shut up and listen. 1. \"Let's be honest. On a scale of 1 to 10, how much 'spine' does this project still have? And what's the single biggest thing, a person, a process, a partner, that's threatening to break it?\" (This gets us past the 'everything is fine' talk and right to the core problem.) 2. \"What is the single dumbest, most bureaucratic, or most time-wasting thing we (World Vision) made you do in the last 90 days?\" (This is my favorite. It builds trust, gives them a safe way to vent, and instantly shows me where our \"support\" is actually a \"hurdle.\") 3. \"What's the one thing you did in the field that worked way better than you expected? And what do you need to do more of it?\" (This puts them in the expert seat, gets us field-first innovations, and turns the conversation from \"blockers\" to \"accelerators.\") 4. \"Looking at Kujenga and our other partners here, what's one thing you've learned from each other that you want to 'steal' or adopt?\" (This builds the ecosystem. It forces peer-to-peer learning and reinforces Kujenga's role as the mentor.) How I'll Convert Answers into \"Signed Changes\" We won't leave the room with \"meeting notes.\" We will leave with \"Our 90-Day Commitments.\" This is a simple, two-part process that we'll do in the last hour of the meeting. Part 1: We \"Triage and Commit\" on a Whiteboard. We'll have three columns. We take the answers from our discussion and put them into the columns: • The Problem: (e.g., \"The new grant report form is a 'hurdle'.\") • The Fix: (e.g., \"We will only use Kujenga's 1-page Learning Log for the next 90 days.\") • Who Owns It: (e.g., \"Okello.\") This is crucial. We don't just identify problems; we assign an owner to the solution. If the \"fix\" is for me to get a budget line changed or kill a stupid form, my name (Okello) goes on it. This makes it a public, personal commitment from me to them. Part 2: The \"Signed Change\" is a Public Email. I will type up that whiteboard list into a simple email with the subject line: \"Our 90-Day Commitments from the Q3 Reset.\" Before anyone leaves the room, I will hit \"send.\" That email goes to everyone who was in the room, and it goes to my boss and the finance director. That email is the \"signed change.\" It's not a legal document; it's a public promise. Kujenga sees that I've committed to my leadership. My leadership sees what I've promised to Kujenga. And in 90 days, that email is the first thing we'll look at. It's how we hold each other accountable, and it's how I prove that I'm here to clear roadblocks, not just get updates."}

A negative finding isn't a failure. It's a signal. Hiding it or spinning it is the only way you can truly fail. My entire approach here is about proving our partnership is real and not just \"theatre.\" First, I protect trust. My first call is not to my leadership. It's to the Kujenga Director. I have to be the one to show vulnerability and humility. I'd call them and say: \"Hey, I'm looking at our latest MEAL data, and it looks like our gender outcomes have stalled. My first assumption is that our plan is wrong, not that your work is wrong. We've clearly missed something big. You're the one on the ground. What are you seeing that these numbers aren't telling me? What's the real story? I need your expertise to help me understand what we need to change.\" This is critical. It makes them the expert, not the one being blamed. It turns a moment of accusation into a moment of co-creation and genuine \"local ownership\". Second, I protect momentum by pivoting. Momentum isn't just about moving fast; it's about moving in the right direction. Kujenga and I would then work together on the \"fix.\" Maybe they'll say, \"We told you we needed to engage the male leaders, but the plan didn't have time.\" Okay. We now have our pivot. I'd then go to my leadership and frame it with total honesty: \"Our field-first learning loop just did its job. It caught a major problem early. The data shows our gender outcomes are stalling. Kujenga's team and I have already dug into it, and we believe the root cause is X—we're not engaging the men. So, we're not stopping. We're pivoting. For the next 60 days, we are re-allocating the travel budget to fund a series of 'male-engagement' workshops, which Kujenga will lead. We'll measure the impact and report back.\" This protects trust because I didn't throw my partner under the bus. And it protects momentum because we're not just stopping; we're adapting based on real-time, partner-led evidence. We're showing our model is strong enough to handle the truth."}

We are burning time, money, and focus on meetings that are creating the \"role confusion\" and \"execution drift\" Kujenga flagged. Pausing this frees up my time, our grants team's time, and, most importantly, the budget we were holding for their \"management\" role. Second, I will stop (and scrap) the current, top-down MEAL redesign. It's actively \"diluting the gender lens,\" and it's a \"hurdle,\" not a \"help.\" We will stop all meetings and consultant work on it, which frees up the MEAL team's time and any associated budget. How I'll Use That Money to Fund the Adaptations: This is the best part. We don't need new money. We just need to move it. 1. I'll take the budget we had set aside for the \"formal partner's management fee\" and turn it into a \"Kujenga Mentorship Fund.\" This will directly pay for Kujenga's staff time and transport to be the \"Center of Excellence\" we talked about. It funds them to do the real work of peer-to-peer training in Teso. 2. I'll take the money we would have spent on that failed MEAL redesign (consultant time, our staff time, etc.) and turn it into a \"Field-First Learning Fund.\" This will pay for the \"reset\" workshop we need. It will pay for the \"Learning Log\" calls. And it will pay for the small, frugal innovations like the \"Market Access WhatsApp Group.\" It's a straight trade. We are stopping the \"pilot theatre\" and cashing in those resources to fund the \"spine\" that Kujenga rightly said we were losing."}

What’s your call—and why?", "score": 0, "band_label": "Counterproductive", "text": "On one hand, we have the \"Align with the Ministry's Agro-Parks\" route. • The Benefit: The upside is huge, politically. We'd look like great partners, we'd be \"aligned\" with the national strategy, and we'd have a clear story for our leadership and donors about scaling. It's the path of least resistance. • The Cost: The cost is that we would almost certainly be absorbed and diluted. We'd be forced to fit our model into their top-down, industrial-scale boxes. This is exactly how the \"gender lens\" and \"field-first learning\" Kujenga is worried about would be lost forever. • Equity Implications: This is the killer. These big, top-down projects almost never serve the smallholder, women-led groups we're here for. The equity implication is disastrous: we'd be \"whitewashing\" a big project, using our grassroots \"success\" as a cover, while the real benefits flow to larger, male-dominated commercial players. • Execution Risk: The risk is that Kujenga and the women's groups would see this as a total betrayal. They'd disengage. We'd have \"scaled\" a program that has no soul, no \"spine,\" and no real-world impact. On the other hand, we could just \"Protect the Grassroots Focus\" and ignore the Ministry. • The Benefit: We'd protect the integrity of the model. We'd keep Kujenga's trust, and the \"spine\" would be strong. We'd be doing real, deep, effective work at the village level. • The Cost: We'd be seen as \"difficult\" or \"not scalable.\" We'd miss a massive opportunity to influence the national conversation, and we'd be picking a fight with a powerful stakeholder. • Execution Risk: The risk is that the Ministry could just shut us down or make our lives impossible. We'd be \"pure\" but \"powerless.\" My Call And Why My call is neither. Both of those options are traps. The \"Align\" option is \"pilot theatre\" at its worst. The \"Ignore\" option is a missed opportunity. My call is to do the harder, smarter third option that your documents call \"Thought Leadership\" and \"Policy Advocacy\": We will use our proven grassroots model to actively influence the Agro-Parks strategy. This is how we'll do it: We're not going to \"align\" with their plan; we're going to proactively show them how their plan can actually succeed. I'll take the hard proof and the field-first data from Kujenga's pilot, and I'll go to the Ministry. I'll frame it like this: \"The Agro-Parks are a critical national goal, and we want to help you make them a success. Our biggest risk is that these parks will fail to connect with the smallholder farmers who make up 80% of the sector. We have a proven, women-led, field-tested model that already solves this 'last mile' problem. Let's work together to make Kujenga's model the official 'how-to' guide for community engagement for the Agro-Parks. Let our model be your evidence.\" This way, we don't sacrifice our spine. We're not \"aligning\" we're leading. We're using our grassroots success as the evidence to make national policy smarter, more equitable, and more effective. That's the real win."}

I want a bulleted list: \"This is the minimum budget we need to start.

From my own Head of Grants, I need a 'Yes' or 'No' on a simplified funding model. I've asked him, \"Can you agree, in writing, to give Kujenga a single, upfront 'working capital' payment for 90 days, based on their one-page budget? Or are you going to force them into our standard, slow, monthly reimbursement process?\" My Fallback Plan if They Don't Arrive My decision on Friday will be made with or without this data, but the data changes what the decision is. • If I don't get the list from Kujenga: If I don't hear from them, that is the data. It tells me they are not ready, not empowered, or don't trust us. My fallback: I will go to leadership on Friday and my call will be \"No-Go.\" I'll state that we cannot move forward until our lead partner is genuinely co-leading the design. We will spend the next 30 days building that trust and getting that one-page plan right. • If I don't get the 'Yes' from my Grants team: If my own team says 'No' or \"we'll see,\" then I know I can't protect Kujenga from our own bureaucracy. My fallback: My call on Friday will be a \"Conditional Go,\" with a high-profile risk. I will tell leadership, \"We are moving, but I am formally stating that our own internal grant process is the single greatest threat to this project's success.

I'd say: \"I'm here because I have to share a hard decision, and I wanted you to be the first to hear it from me. The donor has (or my leadership has) made a call.

It's the \"execution drift\" Kujenga was worried about, but seen from another angle. My decision rule for this is simple: \"We are 'tight on the why,' but 'loose on the how.'\" The \"coherence\" we need isn't about every region using the exact same form or holding the exact same meeting. That's the old, top-down model. The \"coherence\" we must protect the 'spine' is our set of non-negotiable principles. So, here's the rule I'd give to all regional teams: \"You can adapt the program in any way you think is necessary for your local context. In fact, I expect Teso to look different from Karamoja. That's not 'drift'; that's 'local initiative.' But... your adaptation must strengthen our three non-negotiables. It can never, ever break them.\" Our Three Non-Negotiables (The \"Tight Why\"): 1. Is it women-led and gender-transformative? We will not dilute the gender lens. 2. Is it driven by our local partner? We will not take over or sideline Kujenga's team or the new local partners. 3. Is it based on field-first learning? We will not make decisions from an office; we will use what the women's groups tell us. Here's how we'd enforce it: If a regional team wants to change the model, they can't just do it. They have to bring it to our bi-weekly \"Learning Log\" call. • If the Teso team says, \"We want to stop the women-only meetings because it's just easier to talk to the male leaders,\" my answer is No. That breaks a non-negotiable. • But if the Teso team says, \"We want to test a local radio program instead of the WhatsApp group, because Kujenga's team found that women are having their phones taken by their husbands,\" my answer is Yes, absolutely. That's a brilliant, locally-led adaptation. It doesn't kill the initiative; it is the initiative. And it's still 100% coherent with our 'why' because it's finding a better way to get the gender outcome. This way, local initiative becomes our R&D, not a threat to our 'spine.'"}

This has a direct impact on our ability to scale to Teso and Karamoja as planned. The purpose of this meeting is to understand what happened and together, decide how we get back on track, immediately.\" 2. Diagnosis: Understanding the 'Why' (Grounded & Inquisitive) This phase is about listening. I will use open-ended questions linked to the context Kujenga has flagged. On Execution: \"Walk me through the internal challenges. Were there issues with your team's capacity, resources, or processes? From our side, we've been concerned about 'execution drift' and 'role confusion' as we scale. Are you feeling that? Is the 'spine' of the project—our core principles—getting lost in day-to-day chaos?\" On Scaling: \"How is the expansion from Serere to the new regions affecting your team? Are the challenges in Teso or Karamoja different from what we anticipated, and are we adapting our support accordingly?\" On External Pressures: \"There's a lot of noise right now, the government's 'Agro-Industrial Parks' strategy, pressure to work with larger formal NGOs. How is this external environment impacting your focus and ability to deliver on our grassroots commitments?\" On Kujenga's Role: \"Be honest with us. Has our support been adequate? Did the recent MEAL redesign discussions create confusion or dilute the gender lens you were supposed to focus on? Are we, the leadership, part of the problem?\" 3. Co-Creating the Recovery Plan (Bold & Executable) \"Based on what you've shared, we need a recovery plan that is realistic and has immediate milestones. Let's build it together, right now.\" Immediate Actions: \"What are the 1-2 things you can do this month to get back on track with the missed milestones?\" Revised Work Plan: \"Let's look at the next 30 days. We need to break down the next major milestone into smaller, weekly check-ins. What support do you need from us to make this happen? A dedicated technical advisor for MEAL tools? Clarification in writing from leadership on our priorities?\" Feedback and accountability Mechanism: \"We will schedule a 15-minute check-in every Friday for the next month to review progress against these weekly goals. This is non-negotiable.\" 4. Closing: Defining the Decision Point (Grounded & Clear) \"We are leaving this meeting with a revised plan. I want to be clear: this is a critical moment for our partnership. We will review progress together in two weeks. At that point, based on whether you have met the revised weekly targets, we will make a final decision about how to proceed."}

If PSPs miss their KPIs for two weeks in a row, the issue is escalated directly to Okello, the Strategic Initiatives Lead, so he can help unblock any barriers. • MEAL Learning sits under the MEAL Technical Working Group Lead. Their key deliverable is rolling out gender-transformative MEAL indicators and robust budget tracking, so gender equity is visible, measurable, and contributes to the learning agenda. If these indicators show poor progress quality, consistency, or reporting. The escalation path goes to the World Vision Uganda MEL Director for further support and system strengthening. • Community Liaison is spearheaded by the Kujenga Community Engagement Lead. They ensure local leadership structures and accountability systems are active and trusted across the three regions. A milestone is reached when these structures are visibly engaged in project oversight and field-level problem-solving. If key community leadership roles are not filled or stay inactive for more than two weeks, the Kujenga Executive Team steps in to restore grassroots integrity. • Escalation Plan oversight sits with Okello, the Strategic Initiatives Lead.

Promotion of local ownership and trust through involvement of the local partner in decision making and letting the local partner take leadership e.g. World Vision Uganda should also learn from Kujenga Farmers network or even adoption of the local partner's implementation models. 4. there should be an intetional investment in the local institution to strengthen local capacities in operations like finance, programming, logistics. 5. World Vision's funds of about >60% should be channeled to the local partner to ensure sustainability of the programming initiatives and since the local partner understands issues on the ground better and has local structures - real community needs will be address compared to use of NGOs that are costly 6. ensure gender integration in programming where the partner is training gender tranformative models that leads to inclusiveness.

Strategic move for Okelo would be for him to create a grassroot /locally led integrity charter for all involved ie. government and NGOs and local partner to sign.

Governments “Agro-Industrial Parks” strategy can easily dominate priorities of the community and shift resources away from community real needs identification process to government priorities and this might dilute community engagement, ownership and therefore sustainability of the project 3. Formal partners may use the top-down planning, sidelining farmer networks and local innovators who shaped the original success. 4. Introducing multiple formal actors can create overlapping mandates, slowing decision-making and reducing accountability and therefore amplifying Kujenga’s concern of diluted voice and power and role confusion This is how i would design the safeguards to prevent community voice being sidelined 1. I would recommend a governance structure where Kujenga and farmer representatives hold decision-making seats alongside formal partners and can equally participate in major decision making in the project. 2. I would also ensure there are community advisory boards composed of grassroots leaders from Kujenga to review plans and flag execution drift before rollout. 3. Plan quarterly learning forums where field insights drive strategy updates and this should document and share “what works” stories from Kujenga’s model. 4.

Top-down planning Benefits: the benefits would include strong government buy-in and visibility of the project in the media etc , easier access to infrastructure and scale financing from the government coffers. Equity Implications: The risk is the project would sideline women-led micro-enterprises in favor of large agribusiness e.g. GROW program across the country. And probably even the entry fees to the group would be larger killing the homogenous of the community spirit. I also see ghost groups in the project a sign for corruption Execution Risks: the most apparent is the bureaucratic delays in implementation, fund disbursement and activity implementation. There would be loss of agility and field-first learning because government would not be interested Option 2: Protect Grassroots Focus (Kujenga-led model) Cost: i see slower scale-up with limited access to national infrastructure like majority of the projects we implement. May appear misaligned with national priorities but priority to the community needs and this would increase sustainability Benefits: this option would preserve farmer trust and gender lens integrity hence promoting local ownership and sustainability. In addition, maintain adaptive learning loops nothing can disrupt this because it would still be a priority of the implementers Equity Implications Strong inclusion of women and smallholder farmers and gender equity remains central to the project My Call would be “Protect Grassroots, with Strategic Bridges!” Why: • Gender equity and farmer trust are core to Transformative changes at the community level. • Government alignment matters, but not at the cost of execution integrity. • We can bridge by engaging Agro-Parks selectively for logistics and market access, while keeping Kujenga as the lead for community engagement and gender outcomes."}

The purpose of the primary sources of information will be capturing and observing live experiences from farmers engagements, risks, operational challenges and experiences related to gender integration and inclusion for all people especially the women and girls in the 3 districts of Teso, Karamoja and Busoga districts regarding the pilot and scale up of climate smart, women inclusive agribusiness. Learning events/ meetings will be conduct on a monthly basis with key stakeholders as key sources of information including Local and government actors such as extension workers, Community Development officers, Community social service officers, women farmer group leaders, to share learning and experiences on alignments with district and national sector priorities including the Agro-Industrial Park strategy, Market Actors will also be involved in the reflections to share learning regarding the changes in the demand, supply of agribusiness commodities, demand and pricing shifts.

Therefore, a section of women groups would be to be resistant and may not be willing to invest in high value cash crops as per the HQs assumption and would instead invest in nutritious food crops like millet, sorghum, bananas, while others in the high value cash crops like coffee, sunflower and sugar cane for improved livelihoods and boast nutrition at the same time. Given that this insight may affect the program design and limit achievement of project objectives, impact and results, it requires an informed and evidence-based project redesign, thus I would convene a meeting with key stakeholders including Kujenga leaders, women farmers leaders, MEAL staff from partners, government and district leadership, extension workers among others to review the project results framework, Theory of Change, indicators, targets as well as project activities to align them to the needs of the community by integrating both high value cash crops with food security crops and include results of economic empowerment as well as for food security and nutrition in order to ensure relevance and effectiveness of the project interventions and for increase impact.

Increased access to markets and finances by women farmers as a result of improved supply chain policies and systems in the three regions. The 5 milestones will include, designing an execution spine/plan clearly stating the roles, key milestones/deliverables/timeframe and the persons responsible including the governance and escalation pathways to be completed by the strategic initiative lead-Okello with consultations from the project teams and stakeholders and signed off by the senior management Team/ ED in 15 days. 2. The MEAL Advisor-Teddy will Conduct a MEAL design workshop to design a gender transformative MEAL system for the project with a gender inclusive performance measurement framework with SMART performance indicators and targets to be finalized in 30 days. 3. Supply chain stakeholder mapping, analysis and management strategy developed and signed off by the Operations director as well as signed MOU with all strategic partners and stakeholders like with kujenga network and district leadership in Teso, Karamoja and Busoga regions. The owners of this milestone will be Molly the Markey systems advisor and Okello the strategic initiative manager, and the decision gates will be Operations manager to be completed by the end of the second month, Kujenga network manager/coordinator-Jennifer to set up community liaison structures in the 3 regions Teso, Karamoja and Busoga including signing of agreements and setting up feedback mechanisms. to be completed in the third Month-30 days. Decision gates will be Kujenga Senior leadership and World Vision SMT. 5.The strategic initiative manager/lead-Okello will conduct a stakeholder engagement meeting especially with local and national government and sector leadership to review and align the program to the existing policy frameworks, including policy influencing to make them gender inclusive and community led.

What artifact or ritual will you introduce to close that gap?", "score": 3, "band_label": "Transformative", "text": "There is a high likelihood of handoff failure between partners due to the new proposed approach and mix-up of formal NGO partnerships with the local partnerships with Kujenga network which is more of field first learning and locally led. Therefore, I foresee a risk or failure in supply chain and market/business linkages management were the agribusiness and procurement processes and systems of the form NGOs may not align with those of the local partners and government such as Kujenga network and women farmer groups as well asl for government/districts hence posing challenges in aligning to or compromising the different processes for different partners. The other risk or failure would arise in the adaptation and adoption of gender transformative MEAL systems including formal processes and approaches like the mixed methods of learning loops, this may face challenges because the local partners like Kujenga, are used to very simplified MEAL systems unlike those for the formal NGO partners, hence being perceived as diluting the gender lens and sometimes limiting the first-field learning loops and adaptive management hence causing role confusion and system overload for local partners like kujenga. Lastly, the risk of missing out on community feedback and voices through the feedback channels which are managed through a structured process by the Formal NGOs like world vision, as opposed to those managed directly by the local partners in the community. the levels of escalation and feedback management may fail to yield adaptions as senior management may not have access to the particIpant voices given that feedback good directly through the field staff, kujenga network, strategic initiative manager to the senior management, which is the most likely situation in the scale up process. Therefore, I will introduce multiple alternatives to maintain the first field learning loop for generating participant and stakeholder feedbacks for increased accountability and joint decision-making processes through Monthly or quarterly project review and learning meetings including all stakeholder, partners and community representation monthly virtual meetings and quarterly physical or semi virtual meetings to deliberate on key achievement, lessons, execution drifts and solutions for adaptive management and joint decision making. I would produce and publish jointly cocreated knowledge management products from the learning processes like knowledge/learning briefs, highlighting analysis of all non-negotiables such as achievement towards project results, gender inclusion and integration, execution drifts, participant stories of change and feedback, recommendations for adaptations among others which will be disseminated to the different audience including senior management, local and NGO partners, Local and National government leadership for informed decision making and to close on the gaps identified."}

Secondly, I would propose a partial not full alignment with government policies especially the agro-industrial park strategy as the review processes for the same policies are adopted in the project activities to ensure that they are gender inclusive, and do not limit field first learning and local driven approaches that may hinder the project from achieving its goals, and thus policy influencing activities would deal with these gaps during the implementation.

Lastly, the fact that single systems will be operated and not parallel such as the MEAL system, role clarity and definition for all players is critical, where clear milestones, targets and expectations are defined and documented for all the partner staff in the implementation charter/guide, in the workplan and MEAL plan to eliminate the role confusion. To test adherence to the first principle of gender inclusion, I will design performance measurement indicators and metrics to assess adherence and integration of gender through the surveys and track progress against targets, equally the MEAL tools will be designed to monitor gender integration by reporting on sex, age, disability, nationality (SADD) among other variables for measuring gender integration, thus I would review reports to ascertain whether staff are reporting of Sex, age and disability disaggregated data and ensure that all staff are trained to do so if not reported on. for principle two on field first learning, I would review monitoring reports and activity reports and learning briefs or products, also during review meetings I would review and assess whether participant voices, decisions and community views are captured, such as verbatims, participant stories, recommendations feedbacks are included and if not, there should be a corrective measure to train the staff on how to integrate this principle in real work. Lastly the principle on role clarity will be tested during planning and review meetings, where respective staff are responsible and will be accountable for the specific milestones, during progress tracking, the role clarity will be tested by the number of staff aware of their roles and milestones as compared to those who will not be aware or have clarity on their roles and responsibilities for the respective milestone upon which corrective measures will be adopted."}

The benefits for aligning with ministry would be leveraging on existing government infrastructure, resources, markets and systems, Increased buy-in by government, and local stakeholders for the project interventions that may increase synergies and high-level support and influence/advocacy, while for grassroot focus the benefits would include local ownership of the project interventions and processes and first field learning an informed decisions for impact and sustainability. Equity implications for ministry alignment would include, women farmers will easily be linked and integrated into government programs such as value chains and other financial programs lime PDM for enhance capital and livelihoods once partnerships with the ministry are formalized and negotiated, although it may risk critical focus on gender integration and gender lens since women may be left out in setting up the Agro-industrial Park strategy which may lack a gender lens and no women women voices to inform priorities hence missing a first field learning and alignment hence affecting the project principles. While the equity implications for grassroot focus may include maintaining a field first learning approach were voices of women are incorporated into decisions, and hence a gender lens integrated into implementation and scale-up, may facilitate capacity building for building women's agency to participate in decision making processes, take up leadership and co own and implement the project activities, although may limit government linkages for women to benefit from government programs. Execution risks tagged to alignment with ministry may include a lot of delays as a result of bureaucracies involved in the alignment processes and approvals, may face politicization which may affect implementation fidelity and momentum, may limit first field learning and adaptive management due to the rigidity in the models and approaches as well as policies, that may not be the best fit for different contexts and localities hence hindering adaptations and affecting results. However, positively it may simplify standardization in the processes, quality and approaches. While execution risks for grassroot focus may include slowed or delayed scale-up due to limited resources, infrastructure and markets as there may not be leveraging on existing government resources due to the misalignment hence the project may incur more costs than projected for linkages, limited coordination collaboration and oversight management across the 3 regions as it may be costly for monitoring project implementation and there is no government oversight roles which can affect the quality and timeliness of implementation by partners. Although positively it enables maintaining a gender lens and field first learning an adaptation. My call would be to embrace a mixed approach instead of a full scale of alignment with ministry to enable effective, efficient and sustainable project delivery. Because both approaches are relevant and have opportunity cost in one way or another for instance would tap into government resoiurces and infrastructures as well as enable linkages for women to government programs and enable coordination and oversight role of government , while maintaining the fielf first learning momentum adaptive management and gender inclusion and integration contributed to by both approaches to deliver a quality and successful scale-up."}

EQUITY IMPLICATIONS • There is no fairness in terms of Power in resource distribution and decision making over the same, grassroots tend to adhere to power from above and this compromises effective delivery on intervention. • Ther is a tendence of dictating what should be done without facts on ground, the grassroots are on ground and understand the dynamics to be addressed EXECUTION RISKS • A lot of politics is evident in the Ministry’s in agro perks, decisions are delayed which affect the delivery timelines whereas grassroot may have less bureaucratic processes to move things. • Noncompliance with financial accountabilities, many hands involved, whereas the grassroot will try to be accruable although they are also faced with delayed accountabilities and delivery. • Limited trust of the Agro Perks by the communities, as compared to the grassroot focus, they are available within the community. So bottom line the grassroot focus has more lighter points to go by because of their implementation cost implications, limited risks, trusted by communities thus promoting ownership and sustainability.

The guiding principle is to act as local as possible but as global as necessary, adopting global standards only where they enhance the model without diluting it. Clarity of purpose is essential; understanding why Kujenga succeeded should anchor every decision so that scale extends the model’s impact instead of weakening it. Strengthening the system will also require leveraging formal partners for policy alignment and resource mobilization while protecting the grassroots layer that drives behavior change and gender transformation, and ensuring that local institutions contribute meaningfully to decision-making. Successful scale further depends on understanding the stakeholders and communities we are entering and bridging the language between community realities and institutional expectations. Throughout this process, several non-negotiables must remain central: Kujenga’s farmer-led structures and mechanisms for women’s agency must be preserved and strengthened; the gender and inclusion lens must continue to recognize the roles of both women and men; and climate-smart agricultural practices must be upheld and adapted to the environmental conditions of each new location."}

To scale effectively while keeping Kujenga Farmers Network, which is a grassroots organization, strengths at the core, the vision must be grounded on local leadership, contextual relevance, and shared learning. The leadership of Kujenga Farmers Network initiatives is rooted in lived experiences and deep local understanding, which should remain at the center of decision making and execution of tasks. Their contextual knowledge ensures that scaling does not dilute local ownership or responsiveness to community realities. Regional expansion will rely on strategic partnerships of Kujenga Farmers Network that increase, rather than overshadow, Kujenga’s existing strengths. Scaling will therefore be guided by a the grassroots up approach, where local structures remain the foundation, while regional and national partners provide complementary support, such as capacity enhancement, Technical training, and coaching Scaling should not compromise Kujenga’s bottom up, inclusive, and participatory model, which ensures relevance, inclusivity, and sustainability.

How would you design safeguards to prevent community voice from being sidelined?", "score": 3, "band_label": "Transformative", "text": "Over reliance on formal NGOs can result in high operational costs and unsustainable impact, as local communities may not fully embrace initiatives that do not resonate with their realities. Local actors, such as the Kujenga Farmers Network, possess a nuanced understanding of the issues, context, and community dynamics. They know the gatekeepers, have strong social networks, and employ effective mobilization strategies tailored to the community’s way of life. In contrast, formal NGOs often rely on international or national experiences that may not fit the local context. For example, in Busoga, mobilizing young mothers is most effective through traditional women leaders (“Nabakyala”). National-level strategies that overlook these local social structures risk failing to reach the intended beneficiaries. Over indexing on formal partners therefore poses significant risks because they may lack a deep understanding of the local context, culture, and distinct community needs. The design and implementation of interventions should tap into the lived experiences, knowledge, and best practices of grassroots organizations like Kujenga Farmers Network, recognizing them as core partners rather than supplementary contributors. Formal NGOs may also struggle to adapt quickly to changing local circumstances, leading to missed opportunities for community-driven solutions. This highlights the need to balance partnerships in a way that safeguards community voices and perspectives essential for effective and sustainable outcomes. Dependence on formal partners often promotes a top down approach, driven by predefined agendas, rigid frameworks, and donor timelines. Such approaches undermine local ownership and fail to empower communities to define and lead their own development. In contrast, localisation shifts the focus from control to collaboration, enabling communities to design locally led solutions that are both relevant and sustainable. Formal partners frequently prioritize short-term service delivery and donor metrics, which risks sidelining long-term empowerment and community voice. The design of programs should therefore emphasize community systems strengthening, ensuring that communities are equipped to identify and leverage their own resources. Interventions led by external implementers often face challenges of cultural sensitivity and slow adaptation. Engaging community based implementers who are trusted, culturally aligned, and embedded in the local community fosters ownership, trust, and sustained impact."}

The venue will be the field and office, The responsible people will be the Project lead team, MEAL team, and partners responsible for facilitation. Signals prompting a design sprint for scaling a successful climate Women-Inclusive Agribusiness pilot will include feedback from Kujenga Farmers Network, opportunities, and gaps in data management within the gender lens and agribusiness activities. Specifically, Kujenga Farmers Network beneficiaries in Serere will identify recurring bottlenecks hindering progress. A policy shift from the government related to environmental issues and market changes affecting climate-smart women-inclusive agribusiness will also serve as triggers. Emerging ideas, approaches, and success stories from climate-smart women-inclusive agribusiness that can be scaled will inform activities such as designing communication materials and tools that capture workflows and activities. The module will be sprinted regionally as the initiative scales. Artifacts produced each cycle will focus on field summaries, feedback from farmers, weekly reflection briefs from the field team, and learning and adaptation reports. The purpose of these artifacts will be to highlight key themes and initial recommendations from Kujenga Farmers Network, document decisions based on field learning, and facilitate continuous feedback. Meeting frequency includes weekly reflections every Friday, monthly field visits and learning workshops every 4th week, and quarterly cross-site learning reviews every three months. Compared to previous approaches, this new method shifts from periodic feedback during evaluations, limited cross-team sharing, reactive adaptation, and top-down planning to continuous, iterative, field-driven, community-informed decision-making, with shared learning artifacts and digests."}

How will you surface and act on it quickly?", "score": 3, "band_label": "Transformative", "text": "Women's groups prioritize flexibility and relevance over bureaucracy. They often have informal leadership structures that work effectively for them, allowing for quick decision making without the overhead of formal governance. This contrasts with HQ's tendency to advocate for formal membership and highly standardized processes. Furthermore, the groups may operate using informal financial systems tailored to their unique needs, similar to Village Savings and Loan Associations, while HQ may push for immediate links to formal Financial Institutions , which may not align with the groups' current vision or capacity. The anticipated insights from local women's groups often contrast sharply with the established assumptions typically held by HQ, which may rely on international best practices. While HQ's perspective often focuses on regional scaling, formal governance, and standardized processes, local groups inherently possess a deep, practical understanding of their specific context, cultural norms, and community needs. This contextual knowledge is crucial, as HQ's assumptions for instance, about how women join groups based on formal processes might be contradicted by the local reality that membership is often based on trust and personal relationships. This divergence highlights the risk that strategies informed by national or international experiences may fail to mobilize the intended beneficiaries because they lack local relevance. HQ's assumptions frequently prioritize long term, structural goals such as financial sustainability and Women's Economic Empowerment, often aligning delivery with government policies or strategies like the Agro Industrial Park model. However, the women's groups may be focused on addressing immediate social impacts and sustaining their current activities to meet urgent economic needs. Similarly, where HQ might assume the women's groups have poor or rudimentary record keeping and no formal tools, the reality is that the groups often maintain simple, effective records and share their critical learnings verbally, based on shared experiences, rather than formal, documented reports. To effectively bridge this gap and ensure sustainable program design, HQ must commit to a collaborative and localized approach. HQ must first deeply listen to and document the experiences of the women's groups before making decisions about scaling or standardization. This requires understanding the local context, identifying where power truly lies, recognizing informal norms, and navigating power dynamics through negotiation and awareness building rather than rigid control. Furthermore, HQ should not assume that women's groups lack the capacity for networking or advocacy. Instead, the strategy must be to leverage the groups' existing strengths through a collaborative approach. The ideal design requires HQ to respect the strengths of both the women's groups and the formal NGO structure, and to co create solutions as they navigate these differences together. This approach is essential to successfully formalize systems and standardize WEE approaches and financial sustainability goals without undermining the local social foundations and community voices. By guaranteeing the women's groups participate in the decision making process, HQ can design programs that are truly responsive and sustainable."}

What artifact or ritual will you introduce to close that gap?", "score": 3, "band_label": "Transformative", "text": "The highest likelihood of handoff failure in this scenario occurs at the transition from the original, intimate, Field First Learning pilot phase with the grassroots Kujenga Farmers Network to the larger-scale implementation involving formal NGO partners and alignment with the Agro-Industrial Parks strategy. The core risk lies in the potential loss of Kujenga’s deep contextual understanding and the embedded gender lens, which were central to the pilot’s success. When moving to more formal partners and industrial strategies, this tacit knowledge may not translate effectively, creating a classic execution drift scenario where processes overtake purpose. Specifically, the point of failure is the transfer of unwritten knowledge, values, and the successful gender focused methodology from the Kujenga Farmers Network to formal partners, including World Vision Uganda and government actors. Kujenga’s pilot succeeded through embedded, organic processes, which large NGOs often struggle to replicate. New partners, focusing on formal MEAL frameworks and industrial objectives, may perceive these approaches as informal, risking dilution of the elements that made the pilot effective. Without a structured mechanism to transfer knowledge beyond standard project documents, the risk of losing fidelity to the original approach is high. To mitigate the risk of execution drift and ensure the project remains grounded, bold, and executable, Okello should introduce specific artifacts and rituals. These tools and practices are designed to preserve Kujenga’s successful approaches while enabling scalable implementation with new partners. Three key artifacts should be established. First, the Gender Lens Implementation Blueprint serves as a practical, concise guide that translates Kujenga’s successful methods for women’s inclusion into a step by step blueprint, highlighting red flags, cultural nuances, and do’s and don’ts. This blueprint functions as a mandatory reference for all new partners, ensuring the gender lens is operationalized rather than merely acknowledged in policy. Secondly, the Learning Leadership Field Visit Report institutionalizes Kujenga’s Field First Learning approach into a formal reporting structure. It requires implementers to document qualitative insights, unexpected challenges, and adaptive actions, creating a continuous learning loop back to leadership. Thirdly, a Governance & Role Clarity Matrix clearly defines evolving roles, ensuring Kujenga maintains quality assurance and oversight, NGOs focus on execution, and World Vision handles coordination. This tool prevents role confusion and assigns a \"Gender & Inclusion Champion\" within each partner organization to uphold the blueprint. Alongside artifacts, structured rituals help embed these practices in day-to-day operations. The Kujenga Field Immersion Week is a mandatory, hands-on experience for key staff from new NGO partners and World Vision leads in the original Serere pilot area. Led by Kujenga staff, it transfers embedded knowledge and builds empathy, ensuring the original methods are respected and understood. The Monthly Ground Truths Stand-up (virtual or in-person) provides a regular forum for field staff, including Kujenga representatives, to present unfiltered insights to leadership and government liaisons. This ritual flags potential execution drift and holds leadership accountable to field realities, fostering a culture where constructive challenges to top-down decisions are accepted. Finally, the Alignment with Agro-Industrial Parks Strategy Gender & Inclusion Checklist serves as a pre-mortem ritual conducted before major government alignment decisions. By imagining a scenario in which the gender lens is lost, the team works backward to identify potential missteps, ensuring that scaling aligns with government priorities without compromising inclusion."}

The first step is to co-design a single integrated MEAL framework with a gender core, bringing together Kujenga, MEAL team, gender leads, and field teams. This involves reviewing the original pilot’s theory of change to identify the gender-transformative outcomes that drove success and the indicators that captured behaviour change, agency, and inclusion. These elements are then embedded into a unified results framework with common indicators, shared data collection tools, and field-friendly reporting requirements, ensuring gender is a pillar rather than an add-on. Next, gender outcomes should be translated into measurable, MEAL-compatible indicators to resolve the common tension between soft gender goals and the MEAL requirement for quantitative data. Examples include the percentage of women controlling agribusiness income, changes in women’s decision-making power in producer groups, male allyship behaviors in households, women’s leadership in value chain governance, and reductions in unpaid care burdens. These indicators make gender goals trackable, actionable, and aligned with organizational accountability. To prevent parallel reporting, existing MEAL workflows should be adapted to incorporate gender. Field visit checklists, partner reports, routine monitoring forms, baselines, learning reviews, and partner scorecards can all include gender prompts, ensuring gender is built into day-to-day processes rather than added as a separate layer. Complementing this, cross-capacity building is essential: MEAL officers should be trained in gender analysis, gender-responsive indicators, and qualitative data capture, while gender staff and Kujenga teams learn MEAL logic, evidence quality, and attribution. This creates a shared language and mutual ownership, reducing the perception of conflict between gender and MEAL teams. Field-first data practices help preserve the pilot’s grassroots learning culture. Rapid learning loops, short field stories capturing women’s voices, and dedicating MEAL staff time to field observation keep evidence grounded in real farmer experiences, not just numerical outputs. Governance structures further safeguard gender integrity. A joint Gender-MEAL Working Group, with representation from Kujenga, gender specialists, MEAL teams, and regional partners, should validate indicators, data tools, analytical reports, and scale-up decisions, embedding gender protection structurally rather than relying on individual champions. Finally, the value of gender integration should be clearly communicated: gender data strengthens scale by improving targeting of women farmers, increasing adoption and productivity, and ultimately supporting sustainability. In summary, Okello should focus on designing one integrated MEAL-gender framework, embedding gender outcomes in indicators and tools, leveraging existing workflows, building cross-team capacity, protecting field-first learning, establishing joint governance, and positioning gender analytics as a driver of scale and impact."}

All MEAL, partnership, government alignment, and implementation planning systems are integrated into a single framework that protects gender and learning. Compliance can be verified through tool integration audits, document reviews, partner engagement checks, and coordination meetings that confirm all teams operate from the same framework. Thirdly, Protect Women’s Agency as a Non Negotiable Impact Standard guarantees that scaling does not dilute women’s participation, leadership, income control, and voice in value chains. This principle is enforced through gender safeguard checklists for approvals, outcome verification on agency and leadership, selective partner onboarding based on gender commitment, and quarterly qualitative deep dives using women’s stories to detect early drift. By co-owning decisions within this structured framework anchored in evidence, integrated systems, and non-negotiable gender standards teams share accountability, maintain the pilot’s integrity, and ensure that scaling is both bold and executable without creating parallel or conflicting processes."}

What’s your call—and why?", "score": 3, "band_label": "Transformative", "text": "This will prioritize protecting grassroots focus while selectively leveraging Agro Park alignment for market and policy advantages. This approach preserves equity, protects gender-transformative impact, and maintains bold, executable field leadership, avoiding the pitfalls of execution drift and role confusion. Aligning with the Ministry’s Agro-Parks offers potential benefits such as access to government resources, land, and infrastructure, increased visibility and legitimacy, and greater opportunities for scaling through large donors and private sector partnerships. However, it comes with significant costs, including potentially slower implementation due to bureaucracy, the need to comply with formal structures and reporting requirements, and the risk of diverting resources away from small-scale, locally tailored interventions. Equity implications may also arise, as alignment could favor larger, organized groups over smaller, vulnerable women farmers and risk sidelining youth and marginalized members. Execution risks include potential “execution drift” if MEAL redesigns dilute the gender lens, role confusion between Kujenga, NGOs, and government, and a loss of agility to respond to field realities. In contrast, protecting a grassroots, field-first focus maintains strong community trust and ownership, preserves gender-transformative approaches, and keeps iterative learning intact. The trade-offs include slower access to government support, limited scaling outside existing networks, and higher dependence on internal capacity and funding. Equity is better preserved, as women, youth, and marginalized farmers remain included and participatory decision-making is maintained. Execution risks involve slower policy alignment, resource-intensive scaling, and potential over-stretching of field teams if expansion accelerates. Overall, the decision balances speed, scale, and policy alignment against community ownership, equity, and the integrity of the gender-transformative approach. The pilot’s success depends on maintaining gender-transformative approaches and strong grassroots ownership. Fully aligning with the Ministry’s Agro-Parks risks compromising these core elements, particularly given Kujenga’s warning about execution drift. A strategic middle path is therefore recommended: maintaining field-first, grassroots delivery as the core principle while seeking selective alignment with Agro-Parks where it strengthens infrastructure, market access, or policy support without undermining community agency. The MEAL design should be retained to capture both gender impact and local learning, and roles and responsibilities between Kujenga, NGOs, and government should be formalized to prevent confusion and ensure clear leadership. This approach balances scalability and policy alignment with community ownership and the integrity of the gender-transformative approach."}

First, regional market demand and skills gap analysis for Teso, Karamoja, and Busoga is essential to ensure that the technical training and start-up kits are demand-driven, leading to viable employment opportunities and aligning with PEI’s flexibility on value chains. The primary sources for this data are the Government Agro-Industrial Parks Strategy team, to capture large off take opportunities, and the World Vision Livelihoods MEAL Team, for existing market assessments. If these sources are unavailable, a practical fallback is to adopt at least two generalized, high-demand, non-farm income-generating activities, such as tailoring or baking, for the first quarter, combined with a rapid two-week phone-based survey of key regional distributors and master artisans. Second, comparative cost-efficiency data of delivery models is needed to address the tension between Kujenga’s grassroots approach and formal NGOs, ensuring cost-effectiveness while maintaining fidelity to WEE targets and PEI’s gender lens coherence. Required sources include the World Vision Grants & Finance Team, for cost-per-beneficiary calculations, and the Procurement/Partnership Desk, for formal NGO bids. If these are delayed, a phased delivery model can be implemented, with the original Kujenga team or their technical mentors leading the initial technical training, while formal NGO partners manage logistics and cash transfer/start-up kit distribution (ensuring efficiency).

I would frame the trade off around shared goals by anchoring the conversation in what all partners already value such as reaching more women farmers sustainably, maintaining a strong gender-transformative core, and ensuring that scaling does not dilute the elements that made the pilot successful. I would explain how the chosen approach protects the integrity of the model while still pursuing national level influence, keeping the discussion focused on shared objectives rather than creating a win lose dynamic. To ensure fairness and inclusivity, I would begin with bilateral listening sessions with Kujenga, the government, and large NGO partners, followed by a small co-creation meeting where the trade-off is introduced early. Grassroots voices, including women leaders and field facilitators, would be actively included to ensure decisions are not purely technocratic, and concerns would be validated before presenting the preferred path. This approach reduces emotional shock and signals respect for all stakeholders. I would clearly outline which aspects of the decision are non-negotiable, such as maintaining the gender-transformative spine, meeting donor MEAL standards, and ensuring safe and ethical scaling, while highlighting negotiable elements like partner roles, sequencing of scale, hybrid delivery options, capacity support for Kujenga, and transition timelines. By establishing these boundaries early, partners do not feel blindsided or powerless. To demonstrate good faith, I would introduce a phased scaling model, where Kujenga continues to lead in Serere and Teso while NGOs support Karamoja and Busoga. I would strengthen Kujenga through co-delivery arrangements rather than substitution, retain a gender learning lab to protect the gender lens even amid MEAL redesign shifts, and offer capacity-building support to smaller partners. These measures help soften the perceived losses and signal a collaborative approach. Lastly I would commit to a clear feedback loop, including a summary note capturing all partner inputs and resulting changes, circulation of a revised partnership structure before finalization, and a 90-day review of how the trade-off is unfolding in practice.

The regions may adapt their delivery models to fit local contexts, as long as they protect the core gender-transformative design, maintain minimum MEAL standards, justify changes with evidence, and document learning for cross-regional coherence. As Okello navigates tensions around grassroots fidelity, MEAL redesign, gender integrity, and government alignment pressures, he needs a decision rule that balances national coherence with regional flexibility. The Women Inclusive Agribusiness model and its gender-transformative principles must remain intact and should not be weakened by any MEAL redesign, as these elements form the backbone of the pilot’s success. At the same time, the approach must continue to uphold a strong grassroots, farmer first delivery ethos reflecting Kujenga’s Field First Learning which ensures that solutions are grounded in the realities of women farmers and community dynamics. Safeguarding and do-no-harm standards must also be consistently upheld across all regions to protect participants and maintain program integrity. Additionally, the program must retain a set of minimum MEAL indicators that enable cross-regional learning, ensure comparability, and preserve coherence as the model expands into new contexts. Regions should have the flexibility to adapt the partnership structure by choosing either grassroots actors or more formal NGOs based on local capacity and context. They can also tailor delivery methods such as using community groups in Teso, mobile extension approaches in Karamoja, or youth co-facilitators in Busoga to ensure the model aligns with local realities. In addition, scheduling and seasonality adjustments should be made to accommodate agricultural cycles and community availability, while tools and training styles can be customized, such as incorporating low literacy visuals for participants in Karamoja. This flexibility allows each region to innovate while still maintaining the integrity of the core model. At the national level, responsibility lies in safeguarding the integrity of the core model, ensuring adherence to safeguarding and gender standards, maintaining MEAL minimums, and aligning the program with national policies. Regional teams, on the other hand, take the lead in selecting appropriate partners, defining delivery modalities, and managing operational planning in ways that best fit their local contexts. Some decisions, particularly those involving alignment with government initiatives such as the Agro-Industrial Parks strategy, require joint agreement to ensure that national ambitions enhance rather than override the grassroots, farmer centered nature of the model. any such deviations must be thoroughly documented, grounded in MEAL trends, and translated into actionable learning that can benefit other regions. To support this, the program should maintain strong feedback and learning mechanisms, including monthly cross-regional reflection calls, a shared MEAL dashboard that tracks gender fidelity and core model integrity, quarterly learning briefs highlighting effective adaptations, and regular field immersion visits to keep leadership grounded in frontline realities."}

Outcome 3: -MEAL & Government Alignment Without Drift A MEAL framework that protects gender outcomes and learning is redesigned and validated; government alignment achieved without compromising the model. 2. Key Milestones (5) Milestone 1 (Day 1–15) Codify the “Non-Negotiables” Playbook • Owner: Okello + Kujenga • Content: Gender spine, farmer-first principles, execution standards, partnership boundaries. • Decision Gate: Leadership signs off on 6–8 non-negotiables before any scale action begins. Milestone 2 (Day 15–30) Partnership Mapping & Role Clarity • Owner: Strategic Initiatives + Regional Leads • Community groups + grassroots networks mapped; larger NGOs vetted using the playbook (not vice-versa). • Decision Gate: Approve only partners scoring ≥80% on alignment rubric. Milestone 3 (Day 30–45) MEAL Redesign Sprint • Owner: MEAL Lead + Gender Advisor • Co-design indicators with Kujenga + women farmer groups; embed rapid learning loops. • Decision Gate: Gender integrity check—if ≥2 gender indicators are weakened, design goes back to sprint. Milestone 4 (Day 45–70) Field-First Pilot in One Location per Region • Owner: Regional Coordinators • Test delivery roles, learning loop, and MEAL tools with real farmer journeys. • Decision Gate: Proceed only if >70% fidelity to the playbook is observed. Milestone 5 (Day 70–90) Government Engagement & Scale Protocol Finalization • Owner: Gov’t Engagement Lead + Okello • Align with Agro-Industrial Parks strategy without absorbing its top-down delivery logic. • Decision Gate: Ministry agrees to “co-existence” terms; no operational control shift. 3. How Slippage Will Be Exposed Early A. Weekly “Fidelity Dashboards” (Field-First Signals) Track 6 fast indicators: 1. % activities delivered by grassroots actors (drop below 60% = red flag) 2. Time lag between field issues and HQ response (>10 days = drift) 3. Number of weekly women-led insights integrated into design (flatline = gender dilution) 4. Partner compliance with non-negotiables (any breach triggers correction) 5. MEAL tool usage rates in field (>20% gap = redesign failure) 6. Escalations from Kujenga on execution drift (any repeat issue triggers leadership review) B. Bi-Weekly “Truth from the Field” Calls • Direct line from women farmers, extension staff, and Kujenga to Okello • No managers allowed to filter reports • Any trend of “role confusion,” “delays,” or “missing gender lens” is logged as drift C. 45-Day Midpoint Learning Review • Independent, rapid review with farmer groups • Compare practice vs. playbook; publish integrity score • If <75% fidelity → freeze expansion until corrected D. Red-Flag Triggers Immediate pause if: • Gender indicators removed or weakened • Government pushes for centralization of delivery • Any partner tries to substitute field presence with desk-based delivery • Kujenga flags “loss of spine” twice in a row 4. Owners Summary • Okello: Overall lead; protects model integrity • Kujenga: Custodian of the “spine” and grassroots feedback • MEAL Lead: Gender-protective MEAL redesign • Regional Coordinators: Field pilots & weekly fidelity tracking • Gov’t Engagement Lead: Manage alignment without drift"}

In contrast, protecting a grassroots focus ensures deeper community ownership, stronger inclusion of women and youth, and more adaptive, context-specific solutions, though it may limit immediate scale and require more fragmented coordination. From an equity perspective, Agro-Parks could unintentionally widen gaps by privileging commercially ready actors, while a grassroots pathway maximizes reach to the most vulnerable. Considering these trade-offs, my call is to prioritize a grassroots-first scale strategy while selectively aligning with Agro-Parks for complementary value—such as market linkages or policy support—without allowing them to steer design or beneficiary targeting.
