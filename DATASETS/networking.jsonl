Non-negotiables are explicit: opt-in consent in Lusoga with a simple path to withdraw at any time; elected, voting representation for women and youth on site committees; paper and USSD options alongside any private app, with parity of access; and no exclusivity and no single-buyer lock-in at parish points. Stakeholder pathway: publish short 'you said / we did' updates in Lusoga as voice notes and posters; pre-brief brokers and truckers on how the Accord preserves lawful income pathways; and accept the priest’s neutral venue with a clear non-partisan ground rule. Evidence and learning are coalition-owned and light-touch, focusing on WASH spot checks for storage, including latrines, handwashing, and safe stacking; LC3 minutes, councillor commitments, and follow-up actions tracked openly; and adoption metrics for USSD, paper, and app pathways disaggregated by gender and age. Risk posture is calm and adaptive, watching for spoiler behavior from rival councillors seeking credit rather than solutions, and attempts to reinsert exclusivity or app-only provisions through late amendments, with pre-agreed messaging and meeting formats. Donor fluency: we reframe success around locally owned systems, not short-term visibility, and we use micro-grants with tiny ledgers that parish groups can administer directly, ensuring parish groups retain control over decisions and data. If late amendments try to reinsert exclusivity, app-only gates, or non-voting seats, we escalate only through local chairs, bring the evidence brief to the LC3, and invite co-chairs to read the exact clauses aloud in Lusoga so the community understands the stakes. We keep a simple 'you said / we did' record in public view, rotate women and youth voices as the main spokespeople, and use the priest’s neutral venue with firm non-partisan guardrails."}

Non-negotiables are explicit: no exclusivity and no single-buyer lock-in at parish points; opt-in consent in Lusoga with a simple path to withdraw at any time; elected, voting representation for women and youth on site committees; and community oversight, public noticeboards, and simple grievance channels. Stakeholder pathway: accept the priest’s neutral venue with a clear non-partisan ground rule; anchor asks to LC3 agenda windows so farmer representatives speak from the front; and negotiate donor pacing without optics theatre or press events that inflame politics. Evidence and learning are coalition-owned and light-touch, focusing on traffic and wait-time logs for trucks to evidence bottlenecks and queuing fairness; WASH spot checks for storage, including latrines, handwashing, and safe stacking; and LC3 minutes, councillor commitments, and follow-up actions tracked openly. Risk posture is calm and adaptive, watching for misinformation spikes on WhatsApp about warehouse receipts and grain seizure, and election-period crowd limits and safety wording to avoid provocation, with pre-agreed messaging and meeting formats. Donor fluency: we avoid public ceremonies; document progress through community-owned evidence briefs, and we use micro-grants with tiny ledgers that parish groups can administer directly, ensuring parish groups retain control over decisions and data. If late amendments try to reinsert exclusivity, app-only gates, or non-voting seats, we escalate only through local chairs, bring the evidence brief to the LC3, and invite co-chairs to read the exact clauses aloud in Lusoga so the community understands the stakes. We keep a simple 'you said / we did' record in public view, rotate women and youth voices as the main spokespeople, and use the priest’s neutral venue with firm non-partisan guardrails."}

Non-negotiables are explicit: myth-busting facts on warehouse receipts to counter WhatsApp rumors; clear storage safety measures, WASH checks, and incident logging; no exclusivity and no single-buyer lock-in at parish points; and paper and USSD options alongside any private app, with parity of access. Stakeholder pathway: negotiate donor pacing without optics theatre or press events that inflame politics; invite rival councillors to co-chair a neutral dialogue before tensions harden; and anchor asks to LC3 agenda windows so farmer representatives speak from the front. Evidence and learning are coalition-owned and light-touch, focusing on protocol adherence checks on weighing procedures and tamper seals on scales; LC3 minutes, councillor commitments, and follow-up actions tracked openly; and calibrated moisture readings recorded per batch with meter IDs and timestamps. Risk posture is calm and adaptive, watching for election-period crowd limits and safety wording to avoid provocation, and attempts to reinsert exclusivity or app-only provisions through late amendments, with pre-agreed messaging and meeting formats. Donor fluency: we avoid public ceremonies; document progress through community-owned evidence briefs, and we reframe success around locally owned systems, not short-term visibility, ensuring parish groups retain control over decisions and data. If late amendments try to reinsert exclusivity, app-only gates, or non-voting seats, we escalate only through local chairs, bring the evidence brief to the LC3, and invite co-chairs to read the exact clauses aloud in Lusoga so the community understands the stakes. We keep a simple 'you said / we did' record in public view, rotate women and youth voices as the main spokespeople, and use the priest’s neutral venue with firm non-partisan guardrails."}
